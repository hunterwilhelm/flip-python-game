This was inspired by the SHIFT game. The goal of the game is to get to the final doors. However, you will need to flip through the ground by pressing shift.

#### Why?
I have seldom worked on games, so I wanted to add the Python Arcade library to my knowledge. So, this is was my project to learn this library.
